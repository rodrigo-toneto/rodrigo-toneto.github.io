  <strong>Old and Informal: The Labor Market Effects of
Social Pensions in Brazil</strong><br/>
How can informal economies protect those excluded from contributory systems without undermining incentives to formalize? As many of these countries undergo rapid demographic transitions, policymakers struggle to design sustainable and inclusive pension
schemes. This paper examines the impact of expanding social pensions on local labor markets in Brazil. Leveraging administrative data on benefits and employment spells, as well as the quasi-random rollout of pension agency branches, I find that higher social-pension take-up increases private formal employment without affecting average wages. I
can trace the local employment result back to individual responses by combining household survey data with administrative bank credit records. Four interrelated factors help explain the aggregate effect: increased household net income following pension receipt,
a high marginal propensity to consume among beneficiaries, non-homothetic preferences that redirect spending toward formal retailers, and improved access to payroll-deducted loans.
